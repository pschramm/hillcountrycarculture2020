# Spectral

Based on html5up’s [Spectral](https://html5up.net/spectral) theme.

Specially made for my customer
[kegelschiene.net](https://kegelschiene.net/en/), so some functions are
missing. If you need one, that is not implemented yet, please open an issue!

# Installation

If this is your first hugo page, please read the [Basic Usage of
Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/) article.

Clone this repo or download the zip, place it inside of the `themes` directory
of your hugo site and use the `config.toml` file located in exampleSite as a
starting point.

If you want to have a look at a real life installation, feel free to explore
the [repo of
kegelschiene.net](https://git.sbruder.de/kegelschiene/site). It also includes
the configuration for a multilingual site.
